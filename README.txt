PFFF - Probabilistic Fast File Fingerprinting
---------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.

USAGE:
	To obtain a basic hash of a file <filename>, pick a random number <num> and run
	
	> ./pfff -k number <filename>
	
  where number is used to seed the randomizer. To recreate the pfff
  values use the same number again.

	You can provide multiple files in a single invocation.
	Numerous options for controlling the algorithm operation and output format are available.
	A list of these can be obtained by invoking
	
	> ./pfff --help

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES:
	Note that the hashing-over-HTTP and hashing-over-FTP features are purely experimental:
    those have not been tested extensively with all possible variations of HTTP and FTP servers.
    In particular, not all HTTP servers support range requests, with those, pfff will return
    an error.
