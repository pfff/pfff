PFFF - Probabilistic Fast File Fingerprinting
---------------------------------------------
Version 1 alpha.

COMPILATION:

    Preparation:
        mkdir build
        cd build/
        cmake ..

	Under Linux:
		make && make tests
	
	Under Windows/MinGW
		make -f Makefile.win tests
		make -f Makefile.win

	The compiled executable (pfff) is produced in the build/ subdirectory.
	
	Compilation has so far only been tested on Win32 and Linux x86_64,
	hence bugs are possible.

USAGE:
	To obtain a basic hash of a file <filename>, pick a random number <num> and run
	
	> ./pfff -k <num>   <filename>
	
	You can provide multiple files in a single invocation.
	Numerous options for controlling the algorithm operation and output format are available.
	A list of these can be obtained by invoking
	
	> ./pfff --help

EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES:
	Note that the hashing-over-FTP feature is purely experimental: it is not guaranteed to work
	properly nor even produce correct hash (I've observed some strange cases).
