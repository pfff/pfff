PFFF - Probabilistic Fast File Fingerprinting
---------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.

COMPILATION:
	In order to compile the software you need CMake (http://www.cmake.org/) as well as
    the usual GCC toolchain. The compilation process is simple:
    
    > mkdir build
    > cd build
    > cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
    > make
    > make test
    > make package

  alternatively build from the source root dir

    > cd pfff
    > rm CMakeCache.txt
    > cmake .
    > make
    > make test
    > make install

  if test fails, please report it to us. Send us the test output
  recorded in Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log
  
    For Windows, we suggest using Cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com).
    Although CMake can be used to create build project for nearly any contemporary build system,
    to the best of our knowledge, currently the code will not compile using Visual Studio compiler.
    It does compile using MinGW, but fails the tests, which means that although the tool is probably
    fully usable, it will not provide the same hashes as on other platforms.
